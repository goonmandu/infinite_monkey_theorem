# infinite_monkey_theorem
A (very slow) Python simulation on the famous [Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem), a theorem that suggests that if an infinite number of monkeys (or chimps) were to start randomly typing on a typewriter, one of them would eventually recreate Hamlet, and by extension, any text that has existed and will exist.
